# cpp-d

## WTF is this???
C++'d is my own heavily opinionated learning material on C++. I'll try to critically discuss all the available features and their downsides since C++ is **not** memory-safe and contains a lot of it's own corners. C++'d is the name cause you get trolled by Stroustoup and C standart at the same time when writing code in C++.

## Attitudes!!!
This is **not** a "helpful" guide, just my insanity with how C/C++ are handling a lot of things. I often will swear here since I think that this is how **true** engineering should be done.
